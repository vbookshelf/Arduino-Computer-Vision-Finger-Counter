# Set up serial comms between this 
# python script and the Arduino.


# To get the port name to enter below:
# Make sure that the Arduino is connected to the laptop.
# In the Arduino IDE select Tools and look at the port name.
# You will see: /dev/cu.usbmodem14201 (Arduino Uno)
# The port name is: dev/cu.usbmodem14201
# Note that when you use a different USB connection on your computer,
# the port name may also change and your code won't work.

# timeout=1 means that if there's an issue with the serial connection,
# after 1 second it will timeout and it won't freeze up the entire script.
